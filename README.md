# PortfolioCollection

This is a single repository that serves as a "portfolio" of sorts for some misc. work of mine.



# Python 

``ReasoningAgent`` contains some Python code for a classical reasoning agent implemented with NumPy, whereas ``SGM`` contains some code from a computer vision project of mine that attempts to implement semi-global matching to calculate stereo disparity using NumPy, OpenCV, and Numba. 

If you'd like some more samples of Python work that I've done, check out the "ML" folder in this repo that is organized separately and described below or look at the following public repositories of mine:

- [Async Discord reminder bot with backend DB] (https://github.com/mmk150/reminder_bot)
- A fullstack app mostly written in Javascript that uses Python for the data science portions: [EBook DataScience] (https://github.com/mmk150/ebookds)
- My solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/mmk150/AdventOfCode2022)

More work available upon request, feel free to contact me.

# Misc. ML Work

Some of the machine learning projects I've worked on that are described more fully in that directory, mostly using various existing libraries (PyTorch, Transformers, NumPy, etc. etc.). Go [here](./ML/README.md) to check out the code and a more in-depth description. 


# Go

The Go section of this repository has some toy projects that I've been fiddling with while trying to pick up the language.

# Rust

I reworked some old research project code in Rust in [this repository] (https://github.com/mmk150/MillerRabin).


# Javascript

I've developed a fullstack application in Javascript that leverages React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The [EBook DataScience](https://github.com/mmk150/ebookds) project incorporates:

- **Data Analysis**: Python ecosystem (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API development
- **Frontend**: React.js for responsive user interface
- **Database**: MongoDB for user data and article storage
- **DevOps**: Git version control with GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker on Linux VM
